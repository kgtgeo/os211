Chmod Command is a set of commands that is useful in organizing file permissions. This website is good enough in explaining how to configure the command 
in line with our needs. Go read it!!!

2. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)<br>
Thread scheduling is part of the kernel's job which function is to determine which thread runs and when. Scheduling involves two boundary scheduling.
I recommend this article as it can explain well the two boundary scheduling plus it also contains good graphics.

3. [CPU Burst Explained in 8 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
I never heard a term named CPU Burst before. This video walk me through the definition and the related concept well so that
i have better understanding. You definitely should watch it.

4. [CPU Scheduling in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Process scheduling in CPU minimize the time wasted to wait for a certain program I/O execution time.
This article explains the different scheduling algorithms and it contains exercise too!

5. [Symmetric Vs Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-multiprocessing.html)<br>
There are two types of multiprocessing based on its symmetry. I like this article as it explains the differences in form of table, graphic, and also key differences that can be easily remembered!

6. [What Is Load Balancing?](https://avinetworks.com/what-is-load-balancing/)<br>
Load balancing is a critical thing in operating system and networking. I like this website article as it displays the explanation
beautifully ! so that I become more interested in reading it.
 
7. [Fair Scheduling Linux](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/fair-scheduling-linux)<br>
How does Linux manage its processor scheduling? I wonder about this after learning about scheduling. This article has been
very helpful as it explains the magic behind linux fair scheduling.
 
8. [Understanding Fork() System Call For New Process Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxTbksJ2fo)<br>
Fork is an essential process in operating system. This video could guide me to better understand what is fork, how does fork work.
Ultimately, a walkthrough on a step by step execution. 

9. [Semaphore in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Semaphore is an integer variable used to solve critical section problems by using wait and signal that are used for process
of synchronization. Curious of how semaphore does it ? This website article is really helpful in explaining this as it shows you also the implementation code!

10. [Deadlock Handling Techniques in Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-deadlock-handling-techniques-in-operating-system)<br>  
Deadlock handling is essential in threading process of operating system. This article explains in detail what are the techniques and how each of them works.
